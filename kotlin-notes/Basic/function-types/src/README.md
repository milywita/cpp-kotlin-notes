# Function Types in Kotlin

A **function type** defines the structure of a function, specifying the types of its parameters and return type. For instance, the function type `(Int, Int) -> Int` represents a function that:
- Accepts two `Int` parameters.
- Returns an `Int`.

This structure is useful when we want to:
- Pass functions as arguments to other functions.
- Store functions as values in variables.
- Ensure type safety by matching functions to the expected parameter and return types.
